## SymVerse Approach

Blockchains can lead the way to a better world. To achieve this, however, technology must be upgraded while the philosophical foundations are strengthened. 
SymVerse adopts deeper socio-economic ideas and introduces revolutionary technical innovations.

## Go-symverse

go-symverse is a project that is being developed for the SymVerse Blockchain POC based on go-ethereum source code.
Therefore, the build and execution style are almost the same as the go-ethereum.
There is no stable version yet.
